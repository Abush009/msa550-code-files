# Predictive Analytics Class Materials

Welcome to the repository for our Predictive Analytics class! This repository contains Python notebooks created in Google Colab that we'll be using throughout the course.

## Course Overview

This course focuses on predictive analytics techniques using Python. We'll explore various algorithms, data preprocessing methods, and model evaluation techniques to develop predictive models for real-world problems.

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: Python notebooks for each class session will be added here as we progress through the course.

## How to Use These Notebooks

1. Click on the notebook you want to view.
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook.
3. Make a copy of the notebook in your own Google Drive to edit and run the code.
